Since we are dealing with Bernoulli distributions $\\mathrm{Binom}(n,\\theta)$, the possible values of $x$ are $0,1,2,\\ldots, n$, and they should be clustered in a bell like shape around $\\theta$. \n",

The graph then displays the value $\\sum_{\\theta> \\iota} p(\\theta\\mid x)$, which is the probability, conditional on having observed that the random variable took value $x$, that the parameter is $>\\iota$, which we hence abbreviate as $Pr(\\theta> \\iota\\mid x)$."
