Problems 2,3,4,5 are my attempt to make this kind of problem more accessible to philosophers.\n",

The graph then displays the value $\\sum_{\\theta> \\iota} p(\\theta\\mid x)$, which is the probability, conditional on having observed that the random variable took value $x$, that the parameter is $>\\iota$, which we hence abbreviate as $Pr(\\theta> \\iota\\mid x)$."
