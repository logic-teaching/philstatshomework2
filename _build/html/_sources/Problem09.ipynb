Under the above correspondence (borne out in part by Option 2), this would suggest that, as a general rule, we should accept only those hypotheses which have undergone a test with high specificity or a test with very few false positives. Write a 1 paragraph essay which evaluates whether this is plausible, bearing in mind that one will have to have a more expansive notion of \"condition\" that works outside of health contexts.\n",
