# Philstats Homework 2

This is due Friday May 17th by 11:59pm, for full credit. It can be turned in Saturday May 18th by 11:59pm for a 10% reduction. 

You can work with 1-2 other students on it, you just have to indicate who else you worked with, and everyone has to write their own solutions.

This homework is designed to be a review of Weeks 4-5 of the course (Chapters 7,8,9 of the book).

You submit **via gradescope on bruinlearn**: you do not turn in anything on this page. 

In terms of workflow, I would recommend:

- write it out the short proofs by hand

- type up the short 1 paragraph responses

- combine the two by just importing photos of the handwritten work into a word processor document

- you do not need to repeat the question, just put down your answer

- put into gradescope in bruinlearn

- be working near a computer or phone so you can use [the book page](https://logic-teaching.github.io/philstatsbook/intro.html) (note that this file is being hosted on a different site than the book, hence you'll need to head back to the book page sometimes)
