@article{Neyman1933-zd,
	abstract = {The problem of testing statistical hypotheses is an old one. Its
               origin is usually connected with the name of Thomas Bayes, who
               gave the well-known theorem on the probabilities a posteriori of
               the possible ``causes`` of a given event. Since then it has been
               discussed by many writers of whom we shall here mention two
               only, Bertrand and Borel, whose differing views serve well to
               illustrate the point from which we shall approach the subject.
               Bertrand put into statistical form a variety of hypotheses, as
               for example the hypothesis that a given group of stars with
               relatively small angular distances between them as seen from the
               earth, form a ``system'' or group in space. His method of
               attack, which is that in common use, consisted essentially in
               calculating the probability, P, that a certain character, x , of
               the observed facts would arise if the hypothesis tested were
               true. If P were very small, this would generally be considered
               as an indication that the hypothesis, H, was probably false, and
               vice versa . Bertrand expressed the pessimistic view that no
               test of this kind could give reliable results. Borel, however,
               in a later discussion, considered that the method described
               could be applied with success provided that the character, x ,
               of the observed facts were properly chosen---were, in fact, a
               character which he terms ``en quelque sorte remarquable.''},

	abstract = {This thoroughly updated second edition combines the latest
               software applications with the benefits of modern resampling
               techniques Resampling helps students understand the meaning of
               sampling distributions, sampling variability, P-values,
               hypothesis tests, and confidence intervals. The second edition
               of Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R combines modern
               resampling techniques and mathematical statistics. This book has
               been classroom-tested to ensure an accessible presentation, uses
               the powerful and flexible computer language R for data analysis
               and explores the benefits of modern resampling techniques. This
               book offers an introduction to permutation tests and bootstrap
               methods that can serve to motivate classical inference methods.
               The book strikes a balance between theory, computing, and
               applications, and the new edition explores additional topics
               including consulting, paired t test, ANOVA and Google Interview
               Questions. Throughout the book, new and updated case studies are
               included representing a diverse range of subjects such as flight
               delays, birth weights of babies, and telephone company repair
               times. These illustrate the relevance of the real-world
               applications of the material. This new edition: * Puts the focus
               on statistical consulting that emphasizes giving a client an
               understanding of data and goes beyond typical expectations *
               Presents new material on topics such as the paired t test,
               Fisher's Exact Test and the EM algorithm * Offers a new section
               on ``Google Interview Questions'' that illustrates statistical
               thinking * Provides a new chapter on ANOVA * Contains more
               exercises and updated case studies, data sets, and R code
               Written for undergraduate students in a mathematical statistics
               course as well as practitioners and researchers, the second
               edition of Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R
               presents a revised and updated guide for applying the most
               current resampling techniques to mathematical statistics.},

@book{Melia2014-vh,
	abstract = {This introduction to modality places the emphasis on the
                 metaphysics of modality rather than on the formal semetics of
                 quantified modal logic. The text begins by introducing
                 students to the ``de re/de dicto'' distinction,
                 conventionalist and conceptualist theories of modality and
                 some of the key problems in modality, particularly Quine's
                 criticisms. It then moves on to explain how possible worlds
                 provide a solution to many of the problems in modality and how
                 possible worlds themselves have been used to analyse notions
                 outside modality such as properties and propositions. Possible
                 worlds introduce problems of their own and the book argues
                 that to make progress with these problems a theory of possible
                 worlds is required. The pros and cons of various theories of
                 possible worlds are then examined in turn, including those of
                 Lewis, Kripke, Adams, Stalnaker and Plantinga.},

@article{Efron1979-ux,
	abstract = {We discuss the following problem: given a random sample
               $\mathbf\{X\} = (X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n)$ from an unknown
               probability distribution $F$, estimate the sampling distribution
               of some prespecified random variable $R(\mathbf\{X\}, F)$, on
               the basis of the observed data $\mathbf\{x\}$. (Standard
               jackknife theory gives an approximate mean and variance in the
               case $R(\mathbf\{X\}, F) = \theta(\hat\{F\}) - \theta(F),
               \theta$ some parameter of interest.) A general method, called
               the ``bootstrap,'' is introduced, and shown to work
               satisfactorily on a variety of estimation problems. The
               jackknife is shown to be a linear approximation method for the
               bootstrap. The exposition proceeds by a series of examples:
               variance of the sample median, error rates in a linear

@book{Stigler2016-lx,
	abstract = {What gives statistics its unity as a science? Stephen Stigler
               sets forth the seven foundational ideas of statistics---a
               scientific discipline related to but distinct from mathematics
               and computer science.Even the most basic idea---aggregation,
               exemplified by averaging---is counterintuitive. It allows one to
               gain information by discarding information, namely, the
               individuality of the observations. Stigler's second pillar,
               information measurement, challenges the importance of ``big
               data'' by noting that observations are not all equally
               important: the amount of information in a data set is often
               proportional to only the square root of the number of
               observations, not the absolute number. The third idea is
               likelihood, the calibration of inferences with the use of
               probability. Intercomparison is the principle that statistical
               comparisons do not need to be made with respect to an external
               standard. The fifth pillar is regression, both a paradox (tall
               parents on average produce shorter children; tall children on
               average have shorter parents) and the basis of inference,
               including Bayesian inference and causal reasoning. The sixth
               concept captures the importance of experimental design---for
               example, by recognizing the gains to be had from a combinatorial
               approach with rigorous randomization. The seventh idea is the
               residual: the notion that a complicated phenomenon can be
               simplified by subtracting the effect of known causes, leaving a
               residual phenomenon that can be explained more easily.The Seven
               Pillars of Statistical Wisdom presents an original, unified
               account of statistical science that will fascinate the
               interested layperson and engage the professional statistician.},

	abstract = {Taken literally, the title ``All of Statistics'' is an
               exaggeration. But in spirit, the title is apt, as the book does
               cover a much broader range of topics than a typical introductory
               book on mathematical statistics. This book is for people who
               want to learn probability and statistics quickly. It is suitable
               for graduate or advanced undergraduate students in computer
               science, mathematics, statistics, and related disciplines. The
               book includes modern topics like nonparametric curve estimation,
               bootstrapping, and clas sification, topics that are usually
               relegated to follow-up courses. The reader is presumed to know
               calculus and a little linear algebra. No previous knowledge of
               probability and statistics is required. Statistics, data mining,
               and machine learning are all concerned with collecting and
               analyzing data. For some time, statistics research was con
               ducted in statistics departments while data mining and machine
               learning re search was conducted in computer science
               departments. Statisticians thought that computer scientists were
               reinventing the wheel. Computer scientists thought that
               statistical theory didn't apply to their problems. Things are
               changing. Statisticians now recognize that computer scientists
               are making novel contributions while computer scientists now
               recognize the generality of statistical theory and methodology.
               Clever data mining algo rithms are more scalable than

	abstract = {How strongly should you believe the various propositions that
               you can express? That is the key question facing Bayesian
               epistemology. Subjective Bayesians hold that it is largely
               (though not entirely) up to the agent as to which degrees of
               belief to adopt. Objective Bayesians, on the other hand,
               maintain that appropriate degrees of belief are largely (though
               not entirely) determined by the agent's evidence. This book
               states and defends a version of objective Bayesian epistemology.
               According to this version, objective Bayesianism is
               characterized by three norms: · Probability - degrees of belief
               should be probabilities · Calibration - they should be
               calibrated with evidence · Equivocation - they should otherwise
               equivocate between basic outcomes Objective Bayesianism has been
               challenged on a number of different fronts. For example, some
               claim it is poorly motivated, or fails to handle qualitative
               evidence, or yields counter-intuitive degrees of belief after
               updating, or suffers from a failure to learn from experience. It
               has also been accused of being computationally intractable,
               susceptible to paradox, language dependent, and of not being
               objective enough. Especially suitable for graduates or
               researchers in philosophy of science, foundations of statistics
               and artificial intelligence, the book argues that these
               criticisms can be met and that objective Bayesianism is a
               promising theory with an exciting agenda for further research.},

                 Evidence: A Likelihood Paradigm focuses on the law of
                 likelihood, fundamental to solving many of the problems
                 associated with interpreting data in this way. Statistics has
                 long neglected this principle, resulting in a seriously
                 defective methodology. This book redresses the balance,
                 explaining why science has clung to a defective methodology
                 despite its well-known defects. After examining the strengths
                 and weaknesses of the work of Neyman and Pearson and the
                 Fisher paradigm, the author proposes an alternative paradigm
                 which provides, in the law of likelihood, the explicit concept
                 of evidence missing from the other paradigms. At the same
                 time, this new paradigm retains the elements of objective
                 measurement and control of the frequency of misleading
                 results, features which made the old paradigms so important to
                 science. The likelihood paradigm leads to statistical methods
                 that have a compelling rationale and an elegant simplicity, no
                 longer forcing the reader to choose between frequentist and
                 Bayesian statistics.},

              of the studied systems in modern science raise the risk of model
              misspecification. Therefore, I examine alternative, data-based
              inference techniques, such as bootstrap resampling. I argue that
              their neglect in the philosophical literature is unjustified:
              they suit some contexts of inquiry much better and use a more
              direct approach to scientific inference. Moreover, they make more
              parsimonious assumptions and often replace theoretical
              understanding and knowledge about mechanisms by careful
              experimental design. Thus, it is worthwhile to study in detail

               theories are better than theories that are more complex. It has
               a history dating back to Aristotle and it plays an important
               role in current physics, biology, and psychology. The razor also
               gets used outside of science - in everyday life and in

               many applications. Fascinating examples from different domains
               provide a rich basis for contemplating the principle's promises
               and perils. It is obvious that simpler theories are beautiful
               and easy to understand; the hard problem is to figure out why
               the simplicity of a theory should be relevant to saying what the
               world is like. In this book, the ABCs of probability theory are
               succinctly developed and put to work to describe two 'parsimony

                 launches a vigorous critique of the subjective Bayesian view

                 error-statistical approach as a more robust framework for the

                 of researchers who work with statistical analysis, and

                 objectivity and rationality. Mayo has long argued for an
